# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Database Interaction

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database operations and invalid user input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks error handling for potential issues such as database connection errors or invalid user IDs. This can lead to server crashes or unexpected behavior, providing a poor user experience.  Specifically, the code fails to handle errors that might arise from `db.getUser()`, which could cause the server to crash silently.

## Solution

The corrected code includes comprehensive error handling. It checks for errors in database queries and handles invalid user input gracefully by sending appropriate HTTP error responses to the client. This improves the robustness and reliability of the application.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Simulate an error (e.g., by trying to access a non-existent user ID).
4. Observe the lack of proper error handling.
